# Singular Value Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) is a mathematical technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, providing a powerful tool for a variety of applications in linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning.

The SVD of matrix \(X\) is represented as:

\[X = U \Sigma V^T\]

Where:
- \(U\) is an orthogonal matrix representing the left singular vectors.
- \(\Sigma\) is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values.
- \(V\) is an orthogonal matrix representing the right singular vectors.
